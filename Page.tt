This is the Mono Project's project ideas page. For general information and rules about participating in
[Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](http://code.google.com/soc/) for the Mono Project, please see our
[overview page](/community/google-summer-of-code/).

This page lists some ideas for Mono GSoC projects that students can apply for. Additionally, we encourage students
to submit their own interesting Mono-related project proposals. In past years, roughly 20% of the accepted
proposals were original ideas from students instead of from our suggestions. You can submit more than one proposal,
so you can submit your own ideas as well as apply for one from this list - but only one can be chosen, of course!

Other Ideas
===========

If a project is not listed here, but you think you have a great idea, feel free to
[contact the Mono team, mentors and org admins](#contacting-the-mono-team) to discuss or suggest your own project ideas.

Over the past years we have picked projects that were not listed here because they were great ideas, and we had students
that were passionate about those projects. In the end, most of these projects were a success.

Do not be afraid to pick up a project that would be interesting and also help the Mono universe.

You can find some additional ideas on the [MonkeySquare ideas page](http://monkeysquare.org/gsoc/projects), and on the
[Gnome ideas page](https://live.gnome.org/SummerOfCode2013/Ideas) (Mono-based projects in Gnome: Banshee, Blam, Tasque,
Tomboy, GBrainy, Mistelix, F-Spot, ChronoJump, SparkleShare, LongoMatch).

Microsoft .NET and Mono Integration
===================================

Microsoft open sourced large chunks of code this year:

* ReferenceSource: the source code for the class libraries of .NET as it ships on Windows
* CoreFX: a fresh take on the distribution of the class libraries for a new, slimmer, smaller runtime
* CoreCLR: their C/C++ based runtime, JIT, GC for running on Mac, Linux and Windows
* Roslyn: Microsoft's C# and VB compiler as a service
* CodeContracts: the tools needed to instrument your code

We are tracking various ideas in the [.NET Integration in Mono](https://trello.com/b/vRPTMfdz/net-framework-integration-into-mono) trello board.

Contacting the Mono Team
========================

If you have questions or suggestions that you want to make in real-time and talk to a member of the team, please join us
on IRC on the server "irc.gnome.org" in channel "#monosoc", "#monodev" or the "#mono" channel. Various mentors and
students from past years are usually there and can answer some quick questions about the program and about Mono.

The mailing lists are a very important communication channel, students should use them to get more information and
feedback about ideas and proposals. Community engagement is essential for a successful summer of code, so get involved!

For any questions you may have about the program itself and to talk to the Mono GSoC admin, you can use
[soc@xamarin.com](mailto:soc@xamarin.com).
